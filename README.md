# Book-List

<h3> Simple Book-List Project </h3>

Created a mini Book List project using: 
1. HTML
2. Vanilla Js
3. Skeleton CSS

<h4>Features of the Project</h4>

1. User needs to input Book title, Author and ISBN Number and submit.
2. Values created will be stored in the respective browser storage.
3. No backend servers are used. Purely made with javascript. 
4. An Event Listener for delete was added to remove the stored data from LocalStorage and Show message to user.
5. User Prompt will be timed out after 3 seconds.


Main goal was to implement my knowledge on Javascript and code a Book list with Javascript ES5 and then converting it to ES6 (by replacing function constructors into classes and replacing prototype with methods).
