# Book-List

<h1> Yo </h1>
Created a mini Book List project using Vanilla Javascript while infusing it with HTML and Skeleton styles for CSS.
Values created will be stored in browser storage.
No backend servers are used. 


Main goal was to create a Book list with Javascript ES5 and then converting it to ES6 (by replacing function constructors into classes and replacing prototype with methods).



Enjoy :)
