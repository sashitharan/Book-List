# Book-List
Created a mini Book List project using Vanilla Javascript while infusing it with HTML and basic styles for CSS. 
Main goal was to create a Book list with Javascript ES5 and then converting it to ES6 by replacing function constructors into classes and replacing prototype with methods. 

Enjoy :)
